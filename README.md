# HackerRank

*Solving practice problems based upon core concepts of coding to improve fundemental knowledge and skill with programming.*

### FOLDERS

**!ShowCase -** The best examples of my code through this practice.

**10 Days of Stats -** Using probability, distribution and more to learn how to analyze and understand data. Multiple problems to solve for 10 days.

**30 Days of Code -** Learning how to properly use if-else statements, recursion, data structures, OOP and more to improve coding skills. A new problem to solve for 30 days.

**C++ -** Practice revolving specifically around the C++ language.

**Interview Prep -** Solving curated challenges around core concepts such as arrays, dictionaries and hashmaps, sorting, and more. 

**Problem Solving -** Specific problem solving with Data Structures and Algorithms.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Hackerrank Code vs. My Own Code**

Certain problems provide give code as a basis to make a function off of. For example, they provide a main function that inputs the data of test cases properly into an array/vector that is then sent to a function that I create which manipulates the data in whatever way the prompt wants.

To denote the difference, I added a comment of: 

//HACKERRANK CODE

to the functions written not by me.

And for functions that are written by me I will have a general function header like such:

/*

PURPOSE:

DATE:

PARAMETER:

VARIABLES:

*/

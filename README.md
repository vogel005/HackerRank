**C++ Introduction**

**Data Structures**

**Interview Prep**

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Hackerrank Code vs. My Own Code**

Certain problems provide give code as a basis to make a function off of. For example, they provide a main function that inputs the data of test cases properly into an array/vector that is then sent to a function that I create which manipulates the data in whatever way the prompt wants.

To denote the difference, I added a comment of: 

//HACKERRANK CODE

to the functions written not by me.

And for functions that are written by me I will have a general function header like such:

/*

PURPOSE:

DATE:

PARAMETER:

VARIABLES:

*/
